A Trie is a tree data structure that typically stores characters. They are commonly used
to match prefixes. For example, the words "race" and "racecar" would share the nodes "r",
"a", "c" and "e". Then, "c" would be a child of "e", "a" a child of "c" and "r" a child
of "a". 

This trie will allow for insertion of strings, searching for a string and matching a prefix.
