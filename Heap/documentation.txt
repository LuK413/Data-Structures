A heap is a complete binary tree data structure that can be categorized into either
a max heap or a min heap. It has the following properties:

1. Each node must have at most two child nodes.
2. The key of a node is greater(lesser) than or equal to the keys of its children. 

Heaps are commonly used for priority queues and can also be used for heap sort.

This implementation will be a max heap and supports insertion, returning max, extracting
max and increasing a certain key.
