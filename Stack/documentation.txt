A Stack is a LIFO(last in, first out) data structure. This means that data that the data
that is inserted in most recently will be retrieved first. It can be visualized, quite
literally, like a stack of something, perhaps plates. 

Stacks are typically used in anything regarding "memory" of some state or object. It
is commonly used for undo, but can also be used for back, function calls, mathematical
expressions and parsing.

This stack implementation is templated for any type and allows the user to push elements, pop elements, check the top
of the stack and check if it's empty.
