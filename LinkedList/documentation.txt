A Linked List is a node-based list data structure. It is similar to an array; however,
the operations are fairly different and memory is allocated dynamically.

This implementation of a linked list supports insertion and deletion at both the front
and back of the linked list. Deletion of the first element of a given value within the
list is also supported, as well as searching, lookup and checking for emptiness.
