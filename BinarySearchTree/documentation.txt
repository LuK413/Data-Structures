A Binary Search Tree is an ordered tree data structure that has the following
properties:

1. Each node must have at most two child nodes.
2. The left sub-tree only contains nodes with keys lesser than the node's key.
3. The right sub-tree only contains nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
4. The left and right sub-trees are also binary search trees.

It is primarily used for efficient sorting and searching.

This tree implementation allows for searching, inserting and deleting.
